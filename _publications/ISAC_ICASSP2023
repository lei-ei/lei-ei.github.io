**Abstract**: In this paper, we consider the joint beamforming design for simultaneous sensing and communication in a wireless multi-user system. Different from the existing works that mostly are for single target, we consider sensing the channel parameters of multiple targets while communicating with multiple users. The design goal is to minimize a weighted sum of the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRB) of target parameters subject to the communication sum rate and transmission power constraints. While the classical weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) can be used to handle the problem, we propose to reformulate the problem into a max-min form, by leveraging the tightness of SDR, and solve it by a low-complex first-order method. Numerical results not only demonstrate the computation efficiency of the proposed algorithm but also its effectiveness in enhancing the sensing performance in practice.
