Hello, I’m Lei Li, thanks for checking my personal website. Currently, I’m a research associate at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen), working on CSI sensing and multi-antenna techniques for 5G/next-G wireless networks.

About me
======
I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Science and Engineering (SSE), CUHK-Shenzhen under the supervision of [Prof. Tsung-Hui Chang](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/changtsunghui/Home/Index) in 2024. My research interests are algorithm design for wireless networks, focusing on CSI reconstruction, integrated sensing and communication, and multi-antenna techniques. 

Before joining CUHK-Shenzhen, I received the B.E. degree (Siyuan Honor Program) from Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU), Beijing, China, in 2014 and the M.S. degree from the Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), Beijing, China, in 2017.
